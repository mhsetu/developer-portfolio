          Leo Messi led Barcelona to La Liga and Champions League titles,
          helping him earn unprecedented awards. He scored his 233rd goal for
          Barcelona in March 2012, becoming the club's all-time leading La Liga
          scorer when he was just 24 years old. He ended the 2011-12 season in
          Barcelona with 73 goals beating Gerd Müller's record. Now, Lionel
          Messi is the captain of both Barcelona and Argentina and has achieved
          much of his success on his way to the top.

            Lionel Messi, soccer legend, is among the greatest athletes of all
            time. Smashing record after record, he is the second-highest paid
            athlete in the world. Messi overcome a childhood growth deficiency
            to train at FC Barcelona and play 16 seasons there, in addition to

          <p>
            For a time, he was simultaneously the best scorer, the best passer,
            and the best dribbler in the world, and even at age 34, you could
            still argue he’s all three. He has won everything there is to be won
            with his club, and done it with verve and style and more magic than
            our base mortal selves deserve.
