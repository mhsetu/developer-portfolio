          Leo Messi led Barcelona to La Liga and Champions League titles,
          helping him earn unprecedented awards. He scored his 233rd goal for
          Barcelona in March 2012, becoming the club's all-time leading La Liga
          scorer when he was just 24 years old. He ended the 2011-12 season in
          Barcelona with 73 goals beating Gerd MÃ¼ller's record. Now, Lionel
          Messi is the captain of both Barcelona and Argentina and has achieved
          much of his success on his way to the top.
